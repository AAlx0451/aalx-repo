## arm-apple-darwin repo

Hello, world!

Soon I'll add package list. 

All packages are arm-apple-darwin. Compiled on iPad 2, iOS 6 (on-device)

PLANNED: gcc 14; Clang/LLVM; http site (Jekyll)

PLANNED(UPD): gcc is unreal to compile due to arch issues. 
planned: LLVM/Clang; some useful utilities; swapfile OSS 
implementation (DONE! ILL RELEASE IT SOON); google gemini 
api chat (DONE! ILL RELEASE IT SOON AFTER UX 
IMPROVEMENTS!)
